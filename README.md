# DigiPal

A desktop AI companion. Using a whisper C# wrapper for the speech to text, Ollama for the chatbot and then a Kokoro C# wrapper for the text to speech that comes out.
The purpose of this little AI companion is for it to exist on your desktop and overlays on top of your existing windows. 
Goal is to make all three AIs run offline and locally so that the the user can know that the AI doesn't save data anywhere outside of their computer.
